# Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Forecasting

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of advanced time series forecasting techniques to predict stock prices. Using historical Apple (NASDAQ) stock data from 2018â€“2019, we build and compare predictive models using **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **Facebook Prophet**. The aim is to forecast opening and closing prices, trading volume, and other relevant metrics-providing data-driven insights for investors, analysts, and data scientists.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Apple stock price data
- **Multiple Forecasting Models:**  
  - **ARIMA/SARIMA** (with and without exogenous variables)  
  - **Facebook Prophet** (robust to missing data, trend changes, and seasonality)
- Data preprocessing: missing value imputation, stationarity checks, feature engineering
- Model evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visualizations of trends, seasonality, and forecasts
- Clear documentation of methodology and assumptions

## Problem Statement

Forecasting stock prices is a challenging yet crucial task in finance. This project focuses on predicting Apple's stock prices using historical data, aiming to:

- Analyze stock price trends and patterns
- Build and compare robust forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet)
- Evaluate model performance on unseen test data

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains daily stock prices of Apple from 2018 to 2019, including:

- Date
- Open, High, Low, Close prices
- Adjusted Close price
- Volume of stocks traded

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, **prophet** (formerly fbprophet), warnings

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook `Updated_Stock-Price-Prediction-1.ipynb` to:

- Explore the dataset
- Preprocess data and check stationarity
- Build and tune ARIMA/SARIMA and Prophet models
- Generate forecasts and evaluate results

---

## Methodology

- **Data Preparation:** Ensure date-time sequence, handle missing data, and create necessary features.
- **Stationarity Check:** Use Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and rolling statistics.
- **Modeling:**  
  - Fit ARIMA and SARIMA models, optionally including exogenous variables  
  - Fit **Facebook Prophet** model to capture trend, seasonality, and holiday effects
- **Evaluation:** Use RMSE to measure forecasting accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Plot actual vs predicted values and decomposed time series components.

---

## Results

The notebook includes detailed plots and metrics showcasing the accuracy of the forecasting models, highlighting their ability to capture trends and seasonality in stock prices.  
**Facebook Prophet** is particularly effective at modeling complex seasonality and trend changes, complementing the ARIMA/SARIMA results.
